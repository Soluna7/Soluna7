## ℹ️ About me!

🏳️‍⚧️ 21, she/her

🦀 Proud Rustacean and game developer!

🐦 Currently learning Bevy

🚫🤖 Staunchly against generative AI without exception. Do not use my code to train AI, I do not consent to such uses.

## 🗃️ Current Projects:

📦 Exergy: Small puzzle game currently in development which revolves around the second law of thermodynamics.

📦 Auralemma: Large scope cyclic sandbox game I will make someday when I have more game dev experience
